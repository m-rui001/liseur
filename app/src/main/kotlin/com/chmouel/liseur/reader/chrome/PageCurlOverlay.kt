/**
 * A page being curled off the book by a finger, and finished or put
 * back when the finger lifts.
 *
 * The book underneath has already turned: `PageTurner` jumps the
 * navigator and hands the snapshot of the departing page here, the way
 * it does for the lifted turn. What differs is that the snapshot goes
 * where the finger says rather than where a tween does, and that it
 * can be pulled back flat, at which point the navigator is sent back
 * to where it was.
 *
 * All of this runs on the main thread from the pointer loop and the
 * composition; nothing here is shared with another thread.

     * turned to has actually arrived.
     *
     * This is deliberately not a fixed number of frames. The jump the
     * snapshot stands over is asynchronous: `goForward` orders a scroll
     * of the columns on the web view's own queue and returns long before
     * they have moved. A fixed frame count is a guess about when that

     * lay out the guess is regularly wrong — which is exactly the
     * "the animation plays but the screen stays on the old page, then
     * lurches over" the reader sees, because revealing early shows the
     * very page they were already on.
     *
     * So the caller hands over [pageReady], a suspending wait that
     * returns the moment the turn is known to have arrived (or after a
     * bounded timeout, which is the old guess and no worse). The finger
     * is free to move and keep updating [travel] meanwhile — the snapshot
     * just lies flat until then — so nothing about the drag feels slower;
     * only the moment of revealing is placed on the real page instead of
     * a bet on timing.
