/**
 * Whether an address is somewhere only the reader's own network can
 * reach: loopback, link-local (which is where a cloud metadata service
 * sits), the private IPv4 ranges, IPv6 unique-local and link-local, and
 * the hostname suffixes that mean the same thing.
 *
 * Two very different questions lean on this, and both need the same
 * answer:
 *
 * A self-hosted library is the ordinary case in Liseur, so plain HTTP to
 * one is a considered choice about a network the reader controls, not a
 * password posted to the internet. Cleartext to a *public* host is
 * neither, and is refused.
 *
 * And a catalog naming one of these addresses in a link is asking the
 * phone to go and knock on the reader's router. Where the reader typed
 * the address that is exactly right; where a feed chose it, it is a
 * reachability probe nobody asked for.
 *
 * Judged from the address as written, without resolving it. A name that
 * resolves into private space still reads as public here, and closing
 * that needs the check to happen against the address actually dialled,
 * at connect time. That is worth doing and is not done here; this
 * answers the cheap and common shape, where the address is a literal.
 *
 * It is also not the authority on what Android will let the app reach.
 * That is a wider and less fixed question — which prefixes the phone's
 * own interfaces put on the local network, minus whatever a VPN carries
 * — and it is [LocalNetworkAddress]'s, which builds on this rather than
 * repeating it.
