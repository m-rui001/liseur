/**
 * Which addresses the phone's own interfaces put on the local network.
 *
 * This is the live half of [LocalNetworkAddress]: what no fixed list of
 * private ranges can answer, because it depends on the addresses this
 * phone happens to be holding right now.
 *
 * It mirrors the rule the platform itself enforces, which is written
 * over *link addresses* and not over routes. An earlier version of this
 * read routes instead, calling an address on-link when a gateway-less
 * route matched it. That is true of a Wi-Fi subnet, and it is also true
 * of the default route on a mobile network, where the modem frequently
 * reports no gateway at all: `0.0.0.0/0` and `::/0` then match every
 * address in the world, and every server the reader owns and every
 * server they do not was judged local and refused before it was dialled
 * (#241). The platform never had that problem because the platform
 * never looked at routes.
 *
 * The rule has two halves of its own:
 *
 * IPv6 is taken as it comes. An interface holding an address in a
 * prefix puts that whole prefix on the local network, which is how a
 * home server on a global address in the phone's own /64 is blocked
 * without appearing in any private range (#195). A prefix length of
 * zero arms nothing — that is the guard the route form was missing, and
 * it is the one the platform writes down explicitly.
 *
 * IPv4 is widened rather than taken literally. An interface holding
 * `192.168.1.5/24` arms the whole of `192.168.0.0/16`, not its own /24,
 * and a point-to-point address such as `10.99.61.153/32` would arm the
 * whole of `10.0.0.0/8` if it belonged to an eligible interface. Only
 * the prefixes in [V4_PREFIXES]
 * can be armed this way, so an interface with a public address arms
 * nothing.
 *
 * Almost all of the IPv4 half is already in [PrivateAddress], which
 * [LocalNetworkAddress] consults first; in practice the only range this
 * adds is carrier-grade NAT. That is deliberate, and it is the reason
 * `100.64.0.0/10` is left out of the fixed half: it is where a Tailscale
 * address lives, that traffic goes down a tunnel and needs no
 * permission, and a reader on a tailnet must not be asked for one. An
 * ISP that hands `100.64` out on the LAN puts such an address on a real
 * interface, and gets asked about — through here, which is the honest
 * reason. The rest is written out anyway rather than deferred to
 * [PrivateAddress], so that this reads as the platform's rule and can be
 * checked against it.
 *
 * Everything here is literals and arithmetic. Nothing is resolved: the
 * callers only ever arrive with an address.
