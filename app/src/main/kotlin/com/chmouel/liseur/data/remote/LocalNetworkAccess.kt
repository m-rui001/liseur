 * network hangs until it times out. Liseur's readers self-host, so this
 * is not an edge case for them — but plenty of them reach their library
 * over the open internet, where the permission is neither needed nor

     * equivalent and is not: on a mobile network the modem frequently
     * reports no gateway for the default route, and a gateway-less

     * reached another way, and the cost of that is one dialog on a
     * screen the reader opened to connect a server. The cost of the
     * other direction is the fifteen seconds of silence this whole file
     * exists to prevent.
     *
     * Stacked links are not read, because nothing public exposes them.
     * That is where a 464XLAT translation address lives, on a
     * `192.0.0.0/24` the platform arms no range for, so there is
     * nothing to miss in the case that actually occurs.
