 * This is not "has the reader changed anything". Turning advanced styles
 * on does far more than enable the setting that asked for it: it
 * restyles `:root`, every heading, `p`, `li`, `dd`, `div`, `pre`,
 * `small`, `sub` and `sup`, normalizing the book's whole type scale and
 * overriding the sizes its designer chose. That is a price worth paying
 * for a setting the reader asked for and the book can honour, and worth
 * paying for nothing otherwise.
 *
 * So two narrowings, both of which mean *less* interference than before:
 *
 * - `pageMargins`, `fontSize` and `fontWeight` are excluded. Their rules
 *   are not gated on advanced styles at all — Readium's own
 *   `EpubPreferencesEditor` gates their effectiveness on nothing but a
 *   reflowable publication. Page margins used to force it, so a reader
 *   who had only widened their margins lost their book's heading sizes
 *   for no reason.
 * - The rest are counted only when [css] can honour them. An app-wide
 *   letter spacing would otherwise renormalize an Arabic book whose
 *   stylesheet has no letter-spacing rule, applying none of the spacing
 *   that asked for it.
 *
 * A value that is set to zero, and hyphenation switched off, both count:
 * they are things the reader asked for, not the absence of a request.
 * Call it on [sanitized] values, so that a number discarded as
 * unusable cannot switch the whole apparatus on.
