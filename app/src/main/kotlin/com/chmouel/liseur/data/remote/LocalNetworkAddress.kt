/**
 * Whether an address is one Android counts as being on the local
 * network, and so one the app may not reach without permission.
 *
 * A narrower question than [PrivateAddress]'s, and a different one. That
 * object asks whether an address is somewhere only the reader's own
 * network can reach, which is about what is safe to send in the clear
 * and what a catalog may point the phone at. This asks what the
 * platform will drop, and the platform's answer is not a table alone:
 * it is also whichever prefixes the phone's own interfaces are holding,
 * and it excludes whatever a VPN carries.
 *
 * So the judgement has two halves. The fixed half is everything
 * [PrivateAddress] knows, plus broadcast and multicast. The live half is
 * [onLink], a predicate over the phone's own addresses, which
 * `LocalNetworkAccess` fills in from [OnLinkPrefixes] and the tests
 * supply directly. Both are needed: a home server on a global IPv6
 * address in the phone's own /64 is on-link and blocked, and no list of
 * private ranges will ever say so.
 *
 * Carrier-grade NAT space, `100.64.0.0/10`, is deliberately absent from
 * the fixed half. That is where a Tailscale address lives; that traffic
 * goes down the tunnel and needs no permission, and asking for one
 * would be asking for nothing. An ISP that hands `100.64` out on the
 * LAN still gets asked about — through [onLink], which is the honest
 * reason.
 *
 * Loopback answers false throughout. The restriction exempts it, so a
 * reader pointed at `localhost` must not be asked a question about
 * their network.
